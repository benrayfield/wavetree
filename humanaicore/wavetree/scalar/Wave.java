They are more efficient because their classes can be final
and they have a constant quantity of channels.
Of course, since this is an interface, that can not be enforced.

For efficiency, no function of this class is required to throw an Exception
if parameters are invalid (like a channel number that does not exist).
It may, for example, return data for a valid channel, or random data.

If you combine incompatible types of Wave, a WaveCastException should be thrown,
