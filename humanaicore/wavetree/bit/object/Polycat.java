/** Multidim is to multiply as multicat is to plus.
Like struct in C progLang, multicat is cat of things of different types andOr sizes.
Multicat has header similar to multidim, except sizes are added instead of multiplied.
<br><br>
TODO important to answer benfrayfieldResearch.qnMultidimAndMulticatUseLongOrIntIndexs fast:
Should sizes be long or int? Should multidim be same of long or int? Multidim is int,
but I want multicat to be long, so should multidim be long too?
ANSWER: I choose long for both. Multicat needs long because avlBitstring is designed to
allow sparse, and may want a voxel dim or multichannel sound (as allOne vs allZero to
represent scalars like pascalstriZigzag) bigger than int range.
