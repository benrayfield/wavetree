/** Update 2015-5 changing to bigEndian since thats the way people think and multidimensional arrays are.
<br><br> 
Bit alignment is always littleEndian because
if used as integer then its the sum of 2^index for all index with a bit1.
<br><br>
J means 64 bit index, as in the java class file format using:
Z boolean, B byte, C char, S short, I int, J long, F float, D double, Lpackage.class; object.
<br><br>
Constant list of 1s and 0s which may be in an array or lazyEvaluated.
Worst case of log time and memory (exponentially faster than normal datastructs)
for common string functions (on bitstrings) including substring, concat,
count 0 bits or 1 bits in any subrange, insert, delete, overwrite,
and there are potential optimizations for checking string equality by
SHA256 secureHash recursively as the main datastruct is avl tree.
<br><br>
Any length is allowed. Alignment on blocks of size a power of 2 can be optimized,
like if you often use bits objects implemented as byte or int arrays.
<br><br>
Like java.nio.Buffer, bits can overlap arrays of different primitive types
in the same memory, but unlike Buffer, bits are immutable like java.lang.String.
Being immutable and efficient is the design challenge, but as demonstrated by
wavetree.scalar code on scalar numbers instead of bits, it is more than fast enough
for streaming realtime audio generated as wave amplitudes vibrating.
This bit code is a more precise version of that with no roundoffError
and designed to be more generally useful for computing functions on bit strings.
